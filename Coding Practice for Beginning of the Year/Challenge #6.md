# Challenge #6
## Robot Coding Challenge: Advanced IF and WHILE Statements

It is once again time to put your knowledge to the test. Build a program to do the following:

- Start in the starting spot
- Drive to the North Wall
- Stop the robot when close to the wall (you must have the ultrasonic sensor stop it)
- Back Up
- Turn Around
- Drive back to the South Wall
- Stop the robot when close to the wall (you must have the ultrasonic sensor stop it)

Have fun and happy coding!
