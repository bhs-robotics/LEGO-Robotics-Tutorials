# Challenge #3
## Advanced If Statements

For the third challenge, we are building mainly on the 2nd challenge! SO much fun!

You are going to use a WHILE and IF statement together to make a 'motor debugging' program.
  - The UP button (buttonUp) is for making the robot move forward.
  - The DOWN button (buttonDown) is for making the robot move backward.
  - The LEFT button (buttonLeft) is for making the robot move left.
  - The RIGHT button (buttonRight) is for making the robot move right.

Good luck!

```
#pragma config(Motor,  motorB,          leftMotor,     tmotorEV3_Large, PIDControl, encoder)
#pragma config(Motor,  motorC,          rightMotor,    tmotorEV3_Large, PIDControl, encoder)

const int driveSpeed = 50;
const int motorStop = 0;
const int reverseSpeed = -50;
const int turnSpeed = 40;

void moveMotor(int speed) {
	motor[leftMotor] = speed;
	motor[rightMotor] = speed;
}

task main() {

  // Use the while(true) statement to keep this code running forever
  while (true) {
     
     // Check if the Enter button is clicked
     if (getButtonPress(buttonEnter)) {
     
        // If it is clicked, move the robot forward
        moveMotor(100);
     } else {
     
        // If it is not clicked, do not move the robot forward
        moveMotor(0);
     }
     
     // Pause the execution for a short period of time to prevent over running the CPU
     sleep(20);
  }

}
```
