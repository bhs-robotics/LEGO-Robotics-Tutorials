## Robot Coding Challenge: WHILE Statements

Build a program to do the following:

Drive in a square two times. Sounds easy, right? The trick is you can only reference a VOID for moving your robot TWO times. You will need to use a WHILE statement to have this happen.

As always, have fun and happy coding!
